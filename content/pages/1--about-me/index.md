From Ireland, Tipperary to be precise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscrea">Roscrea</a> to be preciser (Don't worry if you've never heard of it before, not many people have)

Graduated from University of Limerick many moons ago

Now living in Cork

Been a tester for over 13 years in Finance, Insurance, Online Gaming, Cloud Platform and Software Development industries

Previously I've worked on test automation with UI and API level tests. My current focus is on helping the team with observability, defining acceptance criteria and using practices such as three amigo sessions to highlight any risks.

Worked/lived in Dublin, Hong Kong and London.

In my spare time I like to play football (Flabby Alonso - 2018 Douglas Astro League 6-a-side back to back champions, nothing to be sniffed at)

I was a keen darts player but am now pretty much retired.

I've been trying to learn the guitar for about a year now with mixed results.. I have mastered Rudolf the red nosed reindeer just in time for Christmas though.
