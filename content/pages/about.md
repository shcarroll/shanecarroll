From Ireland, Tipperary to be precise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscrea">Roscrea</a> to be preciser (Don't worry if you've never heard of it before, not many people have)

Graduated from University of Limerick many moons ago

Now living in Cork

Been a tester for over 13 years in Finance, Insurance, Online Gaming, Cloud Platform and Software Development industries

Previously worked/lived in Dublin, Hong Kong, London

In my spare time I like to play football (Flabby Alonso - 2018 Douglas Astro League 6-a-side back to back champions, nothing to be sniffed at)
 
I was a keen darts player but am now pretty much retired. 

I've been trying to learn the guitar for about a year now with mixed results.. I have mastered Rudolf the red nosed reindeer just in time for christmas though.
